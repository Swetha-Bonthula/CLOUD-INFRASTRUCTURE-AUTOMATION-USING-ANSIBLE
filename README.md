# CLOUD-INFRASTRUCTURE-AUTOMATION-USING-ANSIBLE

1.	ABSTRACT
The way we think about computer infrastructure has changed dramatically because of cloud computing. Instead of buying and maintaining expensive hardware, businesses can now rent resources in the cloud on an as-needed basis. However, managing these resources can be daunting, especially for large-scale deployments. This project aims to simplify cloud infrastructure management by using Python, Ansible, and automation tools to streamline the deployment and configuration of cloud networking resources on AWS, GCP, and Azure.
Tools and Technologies: - Cloud Services, AZURE, AWS, GCP, Ansible, IaaS, Python scripting, Networking.

2.INTRODUCTION
 Cloud computing is a concept that facilitates global access to information, data, and computational resources via the internet. Internet allows its consumers to communicate from anywhere in the world, using electronic devices such as Mobiles, Computers. One of its defining prime features is the "pay-as-you-go" model, which eliminates the need for significant upfront infrastructure investments and provides cost savings.
Cloud commuting has primarily two main models based on the infrastructure: public clouds and private clouds. Public clouds are hosted by third-party providers and serve multiple clients, while private clouds are dedicated to a single organization. This duality offers flexibility for organizations to choose the model that aligns with their specific requirements.
According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), vendor revenue from cloud IT infrastructure products, including servers, enterprise storage, and Ethernet switches, experienced impressive year-over-year growth in various regions. Notably, the Middle East & Africa and Western Europe saw significant growth, reflecting the global trend toward embracing cloud technologies [2].
Cloud environments are prized for their agility and scalability, making it possible to predict user behavior and innovate applications or products swiftly. The rapid provisioning of resources empowers organizations to deploy innovative solutions promptly, giving them a competitive edge. Security is a primary concern, and cloud providers offer services such as Identity and Access Management (IAM) to bolster security measures. IAM ensures that only authorized individuals can access resources, mitigating the risk of fraud and data breaches [3].
Cloud services also enable organizations to gather and analyze customer feedback effectively. This information is invaluable for enhancing customer satisfaction, engagement, and overall happiness. Cloud-based analytics tools provide insights that inform strategic decision-making. Many IT companies started migrating all their infrastructures to cloud [3]. The appeal lies in the rapid and secure provisioning of resources, aligning with the evolving needs of modern businesses.

Cloud computing is a transformative model that offers versatile access, cost-efficiency, and scalability. It has experienced substantial growth worldwide and empowers businesses with agility, rapid innovation, enhanced security, and the ability to leverage customer feedback for improved customer experiences. Cloud adoption continues to shape the future of IT, and it's a strategic imperative for organizations seeking to remain competitive in today's dynamic business landscape.
